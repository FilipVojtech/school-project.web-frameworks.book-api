# Potential Expansions of Data

## Overall

Allowing more fields to be optional so the data structure isn't as rigid.

People can contribute regardless if the data is known or not (i.e. birthdates of authors).
The data that is not known can be added later by someone else.

## Book

- Adding a genre
- Allowing for multiple authors for a single book
- Adding multiple version of a book (language mutations)
- Adding a type of book (hardback, paperback, audiobook)
- Cover arts

## Author

- Primary Genre
- Any awards
- Bio
- Picture

## Publisher

- Publisher Image

## User Profiles

Implementing UI so users can add their read books as well as easily contribute without the knowledge of the API.

Adding "git blame" style authoring notes so people are held accountable for the data they add.
